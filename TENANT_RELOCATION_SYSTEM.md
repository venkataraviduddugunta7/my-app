# 🔄 Tenant Relocation & Cascade Protection System

## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED**

### **Critical Business Logic Issues Fixed:**
1. ❌ **Before:** Deleting beds with tenants caused data loss
2. ❌ **Before:** No tenant relocation options
3. ❌ **Before:** Cascade deletions could displace tenants without warning
4. ❌ **Before:** No protection against accidental tenant displacement

### **✅ Now Implemented:**
1. ✅ **Smart Cascade Protection** - Prevents accidental tenant displacement
2. ✅ **Automatic Relocation Suggestions** - Shows available beds for relocation
3. ✅ **Tenant Safety First** - Multiple confirmation layers
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Detailed information and actions

## 🏗️ **ENHANCED DELETION LOGIC**

### **1. Bed Deletion Protection**

#### **Scenario 1: Occupied Bed Deletion**
```javascript
DELETE /api/beds/:id
// Response when bed is occupied:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Cannot delete occupied bed. Please relocate tenant first.",
    "tenant": {
      "id": "tenant123",
      "tenantId": "PG001",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "phone": "+91-9876543210"
    },
    "currentBed": {
      "id": "bed123",
      "bedNumber": "B1",
      "room": "101",
      "floor": "Ground Floor"
    },
    "availableBeds": [
      {
        "id": "bed456",
        "bedNumber": "B2",
        "bedType": "Single",
        "rent": 8000,
        "room": "102",
        "floor": "Ground Floor",
        "location": "Ground Floor - Room 102 - Bed B2"
      }
    ]
  },
  "requiresAction": "RELOCATE_TENANT",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "RELOCATE",
      "description": "Move tenant to another available bed",
      "endpoint": "DELETE /api/beds/:id",
      "payload": { "relocateTenantToBedId": "TARGET_BED_ID" }
    },
    {
      "type": "FORCE_DELETE",
      "description": "Delete bed and make tenant unassigned (not recommended)",
      "payload": { "forceDelete": true }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Scenario 2: Bed Deletion with Relocation**
```javascript
DELETE /api/beds/bed123
{
  "relocateTenantToBedId": "bed456"
}

### **3. Floor Deletion Protection**

#### **Entire Floor with Multiple Tenants:**
```javascript
DELETE /api/floors/:id

## 🛡️ **SAFETY MECHANISMS**

### **1. Multi-Layer Protection:**
- ✅ **Primary Check:** Prevent deletion if tenants exist
- ✅ **Relocation Suggestions:** Show available alternatives
- ✅ **Force Delete Option:** Emergency override with warnings
- ✅ **Audit Logging:** Track all tenant relocations

### **2. Tenant Status Management:**
```javascript
// Tenant status transitions:
'ACTIVE' → 'PENDING' (when bed/room/floor deleted without relocation)
'PENDING' → 'ACTIVE' (when reassigned to new bed)
```

### **3. Business Rules:**
- ✅ **Same Property Only:** Can't relocate tenants across properties
- ✅ **Availability Check:** Target beds must be available
- ✅ **Rent Compatibility:** Shows rent differences for informed decisions
- ✅ **Payment History:** Preserved during relocations

---

## 🔄 **RELOCATION WORKFLOWS**

### **Workflow 1: Single Bed Deletion**
1. **User attempts bed deletion** → System checks for tenant
2. **Tenant found** → System finds available beds in same property
3. **Present options** → User chooses relocation target or force delete
4. **Execute relocation** → Move tenant to new bed, then delete old bed
5. **Audit log** → Record relocation details

### **Workflow 2: Room Deletion**
1. **User attempts room deletion** → System checks all beds in room
2. **Multiple tenants found** → System finds available beds across property
3. **Present bulk options** → Manual relocation vs force delete
4. **Execute relocations** → Move all tenants, then delete room
5. **Update counts** → Adjust property statistics

### **Workflow 3: Floor Deletion**
1. **User attempts floor deletion** → System checks all rooms and beds
2. **Tenants found** → System analyzes relocation capacity
3. **Present comprehensive plan** → Bulk relocation strategy
4. **Execute plan** → Systematic tenant relocation
5. **Delete floor** → Remove entire floor structure

## 🎯 **USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS**

### **1. Clear Error Messages:**
- ❌ **Before:** "Cannot delete bed"
- ✅ **Now:** "Cannot delete occupied bed. John Doe (PG001) is currently assigned. 3 alternative beds available."

### **2. Actionable Suggestions:**
- ✅ **Available Options:** Shows exact relocation targets
- ✅ **Rent Comparison:** Displays rent differences
- ✅ **Location Details:** Clear bed locations
- ✅ **Capacity Analysis:** "Can relocate all" vs "Need more beds"

### **3. Safety Warnings:**
- 🚨 **Force Delete:** Clear warnings about tenant displacement
- ⚠️ **Impact Assessment:** Shows exactly how many tenants affected
- 🔍 **Recommendation Priority:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on tenant impact

---

## 🧪 **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Test 1: Occupied Bed Deletion**
1. Create bed with tenant → Try to delete → Should show relocation options
2. Choose relocation target → Should move tenant and delete bed
3. Force delete → Should mark tenant as PENDING

### **Test 2: Room with Multiple Tenants**
1. Create room with 3 tenants → Try to delete → Should show all tenant details
2. Should show available beds across property
3. Should calculate if relocation is possible

### **Test 3: Floor Deletion Impact**
1. Create floor with 10 tenants → Try to delete → Should show comprehensive impact
2. Should analyze relocation capacity across other floors
3. Should provide bulk relocation strategy
